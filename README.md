# NeuralNetworkCreator
Console application to create a fully connected neural network. Define the amount of nodes on the input layer, output layer and the number of hidden layers and the number of nodes for each hidden layer. The network matrix can be saved as a nn-file (text) or as a mat-file to import it into Matlab or Octave.

The MatFileHandler was created by https://github.com/mahalex/MatFileHandler.
